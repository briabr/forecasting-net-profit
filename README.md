# Time Series: MercadoLibre
```
In a bid to drive revenue, we produce a Jupyter notebook that contains data preparation, analysis, and visualizations for all the time series data that the company needs to understand. we'll use text and comments to document my findings, and we’ll answer the question prompts in the instructions. Specifically:

Visual depictions of seasonality (as measured by Google Search traffic) that are of interest to the company.

An evaluation of how the company’s stock price correlates to its Google Search traffic.

A Prophet forecast model that can predict hourly user search traffic.

Answers to questions in the instructions that you write in your Jupyter Notebook.

(Optional) A plot of a forecast for the company’s future revenue.
